# Ben-Sadler-Daily-Planner-App

## Description 

This challenge requires creating a in browser interactive Daily-Planner-App, it provides opportunity to demonstrate understanding in third party APIs.

Specifically create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

[Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library will be required to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.
